# MazeRunner
This assignment requires implementing a Stack interface using a linked list. The objectives are to gain experience implementing the Stack ADT using a linked list, write recursive methods, and write methods that throw exceptions. The tester file provies testing of the functions and to see if it solves a Maze correctly.
## Requirements
- Ensure that you have Java installed
## Note:
- Sample Maze files are provided but you can make your own as long as it is in the same format!


## Setup
1. Clone this repo using:

    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/raastinn/MazeRunner.git
   ```
2. Ensure you are in the directory of the files, and compile the program using:
    ```bash
     javac Tester.java
   ```
3. Run a test to see if the functions work:
    ```bash
     java Tester.java
   ```
4. Run a test to see if there exists a solution for the Maze file provided as input:
    ```bash
     java Tester.java maze01.txt
   ```
5. Now you have a file outputed with the solution of the Maze!
